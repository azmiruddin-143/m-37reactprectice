# BPL Cricket Players
###
This Player Purchase Platform is a React web app where users can explore and virtually purchase cricket players from around the world within a set budget. Each player card displays details like name, price, and country. Users start with a default balance, which decreases with each purchase, simulating real-time budget management. Tailwind CSS ensures a responsive design, while React-Toastify provides alerts for successful buys, insufficient balance, or duplicate selections.
